### Exercise 2 - Create an Microsoft 365 group in Azure Active Directory

#### Task 1 - Create the group

Part of your duties as an Azure AD administrator is to create different types of groups. You need to create a new Microsoft 365 group for your organization's sales department.

1. Browse to [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview]( https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).

2. In the left navigation, under **Manage**, select **Groups**.

3. In the Groups blade, on the menu, select **New group**.

4. Create a group using the following information:

    | **Setting**| **Value**|

    | Group type| Microsoft 365|
    | Group name| Northwest Sales|
    | Membership type| Assigned|
    | Owners| *Assign your own administrator account as the group owner*|
    | Members| **Alex Wilber** and **Bianca Pisani**|

    ![Screen image displaying the New Group blade with Group type, Group name, Owners, and Members highlighted](./media/lp1-mod2-create-o365-group.png)

5. When complete, verify the group named **Northwest sales** is shown in the **All groups** list.


### Exercise 3 - Change group license assignments
# RobertS --> Either we don't need this exercise - because it is the same as the Exercise with DeliaD above or we need to switch DeliaD to be a INHERITED license.  Then add the sg-SC300-O365 and put licenses and then add DeliaD to it, so we can show that she has a Direct Windows 11.  Or something like that.

#### Task - Use Azure AD portal to make changes

Occasionally, you may need to change the license assignment that are used by an Azure AD security group. You must ensure you are familiar with the procedure for changing a group's license assignment.

1. Browse to [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview]( https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).

2. In the left navigation, under **Manage**, select **Groups**.

3. Select the **sg-Finance** group.

4. In the left navigation, under **Manage**, select **Licenses**.

5. Review the current assignments and then, on the menu, select **+ Assignments**.

    ![Screen image displaying group license option selected with the current licenses and Assignments menu option highlighted](./media/lp1-mod2-change-group-license.png)

6. On the Update license assignments blade, select **Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3** license, clear the selection of an existing license, add or remove license options, or any combination.

7. When complete, select **Save**.

8. On the groupâ€™s Licenses page, review the change.


### Exercise 4 - Creating a dynamic group with all users as members

#### Task 1 - Create the dynamic group

As your company grows, manually group management is too time consuming. Since standardizing the directory, you can now take advantage of dynamic groups. You must create a new dynamic group to ensure you're ready for dynamic group creation in production.

1. Sign in to the [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Global administrator or User administrator role in the tenant.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory**.

3. Under **Manage**, select **Groups**, and then select **New group**.

4. On the New Group page, under **Group type**, select **Security**.

5. In the **Group name** box, enter **SC300-myDynamicGroup**.

6. Select the **Membership type** menu and then select **Dynamic User**.

# RobertS --> Not a requirement, but good hygene to add an owner of the group?

7. Under **Dynamic user members**, select **Add dynamic query**.

8. On the right above the **Rule syntax** box, select **Edit**.

9. In the Edit rule syntax pane, enter the following expression in the **Rule syntax** box:

    ```powershell
    user.objectid -ne null
    ```

    **Warning** - the `user.objectid` is case sensitive.

10. Select **OK**. The rule appears in the Rule syntax box.

    ![Screen image displaying the dynamic group membership rules blade with rule syntax highlighted](./media/lp1-mod3-dynamic-group-membership-rule.png)

11. Select **Save**. The new dynamic group will now include B2B guest users as well as member users.

12. On the New group page, select **Create** to create the group.

#### Task 2 - Verify the members have been added
# RobertS --> From what I can tell, it takes up to 15 minutes for the membership to be populates on the Skillable lab environment.  Although for my testing today, it only took about 2 minutes.  Might want a note here for that.

1. Click on the **Home** `Azure Active Directory`.
2. Launch **Azure Active Directory**.
3. In the **Manage** menu click on **Groups**.
4. In the filter box type **SC300** and your newly created group will be listed.
5. Click on **SC300-myDynamicGroup** to open the group.
6. Notice that it shows that it contains 30+ **Direct members*.
7. Click on **Members** in the **Manage** menu.
8. Review the members.

#### Task 3 - Experiment with alternate rules

1. Try making a group with only **Guest** users:
   - (user.objectid -ne null) and (user.userType -eq "Guest")

2. Try make a group with only **Members** of the Azure AD users.
   - (user.objectid -ne null) and (user.userType -eq "Member")
